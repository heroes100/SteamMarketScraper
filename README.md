# SteamMarketScraper

This script can scrape the steam marketplace website to gather Counter Strike: Global Offensive weapon skin prices. This data is can then be pickled into a file for permanent storage. This weapon skin data once retrieved/updated can be used to calculate probable profitable purchases when the skins are used ina trade up contract.

Note: This script does not currently include specific weapon skin float values in it's calculations. This can lead to weapon skins requiring a higher than 'x' float value for the trade-up to be viable, but this value and requirement will not be mentioned when using the script. To verify float values, check the avaiable float value(s) on the skin you are attempting to trade up for.

By using this script, I (the creater) do not take any responsibilty for any damages that may occur as an outcome (financial or other).
